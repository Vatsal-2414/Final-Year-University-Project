<h2>N-Body Simulations of Star-Star Encounters</h2>
<br>
The aim of this project was to produce N-Body simulations of a system of objects which interact gravitationally with each other, and track the evolution of this system. In the Universe, stars like our Sun form in groups/clusters in galaxies. Gravitational interactions between the stars affect the dynamical properties of the cluster. To understand how a typical stellar cluster evolves over time, N-Body simulations of our Solar System were produced. The Solar System is a perfect example of an N-Body system.
