# University Projects

## 1. Final Year University Project
<h2>N-Body Simulations of Star-Star Encounters</h2>
<br>
The aim of this project was to produce N-Body simulations of a system of objects which interact gravitationally with each other, and track the evolution of this system. In the Universe, stars like our Sun form in groups/clusters in galaxies. Gravitational interactions between the stars affect the dynamical properties of the cluster. To understand how a typical stellar cluster evolves over time, N-Body simulations of our Solar System were produced. The Solar System is a perfect example of an N-Body system.

## 2. Third Year Observing Project
<h2>Estimation and Comparison of Star Formation Rates (SFR) of Galaxies along the Hubble Sequence</h2>
<br>
The SFR of three galaxies of different Hubble Types was estimated using flux measurements from the H-alpha emission line (wavelength = 656.46 nm) with the help of aperture photometry technique. The aim was to investigate the relationship between the SFR and the type of galaxy observed. Python was the main programming language used to perform data reduction of the images taken. The folder contains the project report and transcript of the code.

## 3. Second Year Observing Project
<h2>Estimation of Physical Parameters like Age and Distance for NGC7789 from H-R Diagram</h2>
<br>
The aim of this project was to construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of open cluster NGC7789 and estimate the age and distance parameters for the cluster. The 0.40m 16inch Meade LX200-ACF Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope was operated for observing NGC7789 with exposures of 30s and 300s used for images. AstroimageJ and Topcat softwares are used in the process of calculations for the parameters. The folder contains the project report.
